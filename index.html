                <p> Hello! My name is Jackson Tanner. I am a Web Developer that graduated from Devmountain in June 2019. Since I could remember I was always in love with what was behind a computer, video games, movies, and other electronics. </p>
    
                <p>I envided people with a creative mind and attitude because I felt that was something I lacked. I started to surround myself with those type of people and began to fall in love with the web development world. I really enjoy freelance work. It gives me an opportunity to express my creative mind and show the world what i can do. Besides finding me in front of my computer, I love almost any type of extreme sport such as snowboarding, mountain biking, skim boarding. </p>
